This is taking forever to book a new flight.

The airline just cancelled all flights out of here.
Can you help me with my travel plans today?
This is ridiculous I'm going to miss my flight.
I've been trying for 3 hours to book a new one.
It's not fair that the good seats are all gone.
My original flight was changed and now I'm stuck.
The website just crashed, can you call it back up?

I've tried every airline and nothing works here.
This journey has been an utter disaster so far.
